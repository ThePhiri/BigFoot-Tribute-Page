           <h3>Did you know?</h3>
           <p>For centuries large ape sightings have been reported in North America. Indigenous peoples created a great variety of names for these animals, as did early settlers and residents in many rural communities. Often referred to in the past as the “Hairy Man,” “Booger” or “Wildman,” and often referred to in the modern vernacular as the sasquatch or “Bigfoot,” the North American Wood Ape Conservancy refers to them as wood apes.  Some contemporary observers dismiss all such accounts as the products of imagination or misidentification, while others ascribe metaphysical origins to the sightings and stories. The North American Wood Ape Conservancy maintains that the source of these legends and the more recent accounts is a primate, as yet undocumented by science. Although wary in the extreme and undoubtedly intelligent, described wood ape behaviors are consistent with what should be expected of a living species.</p>
            <p>While wood ape sightings are often identified or associated with northwestern states and provinces, the species also appears to be resident in the most remote and heavily forested regions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. Opinions on the question of the relatedness of the animals vary, some arguing that individuals in the southern wood ape population may be slightly smaller on average. However, based on witness descriptions, tracks, photographs, and other forms of evidence, the creatures observed in the Pacific Northwest appear to be the same species as those observed in Texas and adjacent states.</p>

         <div class="left">
           <p> Bigfoot has been reported and documented for hundreds of years. Here are some of the interesting ones.</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Mating season is March through April. Grady Grange witnessed firsthand a couple of Bigfoot mating in the middle of March. Doggy style.</li>
               <li>Brown isn’t the only documented fur color. There have been reports of black, gray, white, and even a greenish-blue.</li>
               <li> Bigfoot can run up to 30mph. –Documented in Indiana by Royal Cruden in a four-wheeler incident.</li>
               <li>Bigfoot can jump the full length of their bodies. –Documented in Asian-Pacific by Chung-Li Fuki, noting “the beast leaped an 8 – 10 foot river in one bound.”</li>
               <li>In 1765, England was attacked by three “giants” covered in animal fur. The documentation was lost 50 years ago when it was brought to the American ear.</li>
               <li>1965: Bigfoot was officially put on the endangered species list in Russia. 1967: Germany and France follow suit.</li>
               <li>1897: Bananas, nuts and berries were fed to a captured Bigfoot in Brazil. The Bigfoot ate all the food except the bananas, then escaped.</li>
               <li>Bigfoots are immune to pepper spray, and have been known of “being incapable of sneezing.”</li>
               <li>April 3rd, 1985: A small boy in Oregon was born and put on display due to being completely covered in hair.</li>
               <li>1919: Fred Jancat attacked and killed in Maine. Attacker unknown, but blamed on an 8 ft male individual with disfigured face, “ape-like,” non-English speaking. “The male individual didn’t stop grunting until Fred’s skull was shattered, he then retreated into the woods.” –Jim “Jimboni” Archilli</li>
               <li>1940: Flags were raised in Arizona when a deer was brutally killed by a group of Mexican men. Translators say that the men were sacrificing the deer for a giant “Mono” (ape) they had seen while crossing the border. They said that the animal had been following them for over 10 miles.</li>
               <li>2010: Outside Boise, ID, new artifacts were found in multiple caves portraying a giant “bear,” consistently walking on its hind legs like a man.</li>
               <li>June, 2000: Bones found in Klamath, OR. The “human” remains would be that of the tallest man in the world. Laid out, the individual stood 9 ft 6 in. The femur bone measured 4 ft 1 in.</li>
